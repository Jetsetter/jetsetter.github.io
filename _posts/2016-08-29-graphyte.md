[graphyte](https://github.com/Jetsetter/graphyte) is a small Python library that sends data to a [Graphite](https://graphiteapp.org/) metrics server. We wrote it because the existing graphitesend library [didn't support](https://github.com/daniellawrence/graphitesend/issues/59) Python 3, and it also required gevent for asyncronous use. graphyte is compatible with Python 3.4+ as well as Python 2.7, and uses the standard library's threading module for asynchronous use.

We've recently started to use Python in production at Jetsetter (version 3.5 specifically) for various image processing tasks, so compatibility with Python 3.x is important to us. The library is small and stand-alone (pure Python, no external dependencies), so it wasn't hard to release it as open source. Jetsetter is using the official [PyPI version](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/graphyte/) in our own server and it's working well so far! Here's a screenshot Grafana screenshot showing one of the "graphyte" metrics we're pushing through:

The library is [on the Python Package Index (PyPI)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/graphyte/), so to install it, fire up a
command prompt, activate your virtualenv if you're using one, and type:

    pip install graphyte

Using graphyte is simple -- just call `init()` to initialize the default
sender and then `send()` to send a message. For example, to send
`system.sync.foo.bar 42 {timestamp}\n` to graphite.example.com:2003
synchronously:

```python
import graphyte
graphyte.init('graphite.example.com', prefix='system.sync')
graphyte.send('foo.bar', 42)
```

If you want to send asynchronously on a background thread (for example, in a
web server context), just specify a send interval. For example, this will
setup a background thread to send every 10 seconds:

```python
graphyte.init('graphite.example.com', prefix='system.async', interval=10)
graphyte.send('foo.bar', 42)
```

For (moderately) more advanced examples and other info, see the [Jetsetter/graphyte repo on GitHub](https://github.com/Jetsetter/graphyte).
