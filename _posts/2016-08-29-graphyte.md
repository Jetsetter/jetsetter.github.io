[graphyte](https://github.com/Jetsetter/graphyte) is a small Python library that sends data to a Graphite metrics server (Carbon). We wrote it because the existing graphitesend library didn't support Python 3, and it also required gevent for asyncronous use. graphyte is compatible with Python 3.4+ as well as Python 2.7, and uses the standard library's threading module for asynchronous use.
